### COMPILE

Follow the instructions given in openstack/README to compile this project.

### NOTES

## Overall picture

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Shm9Ly573lBrPtXplggYNc7knSMxo-md997gtIvLaTE/edit?usp=sharing

## Metadata server

Since Numergy does not provide yet any mechanism of user_data passing, a
simple metadata server was implemented. The server itself is a keystore server,
specifically ElasticSearch server. Download it and execute it:

   $ ./bin/elasticsearch -f

It will expose its service on port 9200 usually. This server must be reachable
from all the new VMs.

## VM images (base VM)

Numergy's API allows duplication of VMs, so a baseInstanceId (base VM) is required
rather than an imageId.

This base VM should be configured in such a way that at boot time it launches
the script provided.

<see start-node.sh script>

One way of executing this script every time the VM boots (for Ubuntu OS) is
by creating a service script, do it as follows:

#Put this service-script in /etc/init.d/panode in the base VM.
###############################################
#!/bin/bash
case "$1" in
  start)
    nohup /path/to/start-node.sh &> /tmp/start-node.log &
    ;;
  stop)
    pkill java
    ;;
  *)
  ;;
esac
###############################################

Then execute in the base VM.

   $ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/panode
   $ sudo update-rc.d panode defaults 98 02


You will have to manually modify start-node.sh to correctly point at the Metadata
server, according to its IP address in the VMs network.

### USE

After you compiled your scheduler and connectors as described above proceed
as follows: 

1. Add the following line

   org.ow2.proactive.iaas.numergy.NumergyInfrastructure 

to the text file

   config/rm/nodesource/infrastructures

2. Launch the scheduler

3. Acquire nodes from Numergy

## Static approach

   <see create-numergy-nodesource-static.sh>

## Dynamic approach for the job that needs resources from Numergy on demand


   <see create-numergy-nodesource-dynamic.sh>

# Job Example

   <see file job.xml>
